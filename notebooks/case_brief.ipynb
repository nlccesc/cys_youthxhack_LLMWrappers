    "Organizations routinely communicate essential updates, promotions, and important notices to their customers through various channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "These channels are generally perceived as trustworthy by users, leading to a high level of engagement. \n",
    "However, threat actors have increasingly taken advantage of this trust by embedding deceptive digital interactions within these communications. Such tactics make it challenging for users to distinguish between legitimate communications and those designed to exploit them. \n",

    "Harmful elements, including but not limited to, scannable QR codes, clickable links, digital identifiers, tracking codes, digital markers, and signatures. These are designed to trick recipients into interacting with fake websites, sharing sensitive information, or even installing harmful software. "
